# Titanic Survival Prediction
This is a machine learning project that aims to predict the probability of a passenger surviving the Titanic disaster based on their characteristics. The project consists of two main parts:

1. Model training: We will train a set of classification machine learning models (perceptron, logistic regression, and decision tree) using the Titanic dataset. The goal is to find the best model or combination of models that can accurately predict whether a passenger would survive or not.

2. Feature importance analysis: We will analyze the importance of each feature (i.e., passenger characteristic) in each of the predictive models. This is known as feature importance and can help us understand which features are the most significant predictors of survival.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is stored in *data.csv*. It contains information about the passengers who were on board the Titanic, including their survival status, age, gender, class, fare, and other relevant characteristics. The dataset was obtained from Kaggle, and you can find more information about it here.

## Requirements
To run the code in this project, you will need to install the following Python packages:

- pandas
- numpy
- sklearn
- matplotlib
- seaborn

You can install them using pip or any other package manager of your choice.

## Usage
To run the project, open the titanic_prediction.ipynb notebook in Jupyter or any other compatible environment. The notebook contains detailed instructions on how to train the models and perform the feature importance analysis.

Make sure to set the working directory to the location of the data.csv file before running the code. Also, note that the notebook assumes that the data is in a specific format and may need to be adapted if your dataset has different features or column names.

## Acknowledgments
This project was inspired by the Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster competition on Kaggle. Special thanks to the creators of the dataset and the scikit-learn library for providing the tools necessary for this project.
